# Homework
Just a safe repo for all the CSUnibo/[ADMstaff](students.cs.unibo.it) Lab's Homeworks

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
